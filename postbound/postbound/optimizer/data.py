    annotated by the join predicate. Additionally, the join graph stores index information for each of the relevant
    columns in the query.

    A join graph is a mutable structure, i.e. it also models the current state of the optimizer once specific tables
    have been included in an intermediate join result.

    The wording of the different join graph methods distinguishes three states of joins (and correspondingly tables):

    - a join might be `free`, if at least one of the corresponding tables have not been marked as joined, yet
    - a join might be `available`, if it is `free` and one of the tables is already included in some intermediate join
    - a join is `consumed`, if its no longer `free`

    A further distinction is made between n:m joins and primary key/foreign key joins and information about the
    available joins of each type can be queried easily. To determine the precise join types, a join graph needs to
    access the database schema.

    By calling the `mark_joined` method,  the state of individual joins and their corresponding tables might change.
    This also means that former primary key/foreign key joins might become n:m joins (which is the case exactly when
