    overwrite the global settings, i.e. it is possible to assign a nested loop join to a specific set of tables, but
    disable NLJ globally. In this case, only the specified join will be executed as an NLJ and other algorithms are
    used for all other joins

    the actual query execution should determine the best operators by itself.

    supplying a single base table will provide the associated scan operator, supplying an iterable of base tables
    the join operator and supplying an operator will return the global setting.
