class OptimizationPipeline:
    """The optimization pipeline is the main tool to apply and combine different optimization strategies.

    Each pipeline consists of up to four steps, which completely specify the optimization settings that should be
    applied to an incoming query. For each of the steps general interface exist that must be implemented by the
    selected strategies.

    The steps are applied in consecutive order and perform the following tasks:

    1. the incoming query is checked for unsupported features
    2. an optimized join order for the query is calculated
    3. appropriate physical operators are determined, depending on the join order
    4. the query plan (join order + physical operators) is further parameterized

    All steps are optional. If they are not specified, no operation will be performed at the specific stage.

    Once the optimization settings have been selected via the _setup_ methods (or alternatively via the `load_settings`
    functionality), the pipeline has to be build using the `build` method. Afterwards, it is ready to optimize
    input queries.

    A pipeline depends on a specific database system. This is necessary to produce the appropriate metadata for an
    input query (i.e. to apply the specifics that enforce the optimized query plan during query execution for the
    database system). This field can be changed between optimization calls to use the same pipeline for different
    systems.
